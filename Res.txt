Resilience Testing Document for Entitments-Hub UI Application

1. Introduction
   This document outlines the resilience testing plan for the Entitments-Hub UI application, which is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with three replica sets and three pods. Resilience testing aims to assess the application's ability to withstand and recover from failures while maintaining functionality.

2. Application Overview
   - Application Name: Entitments-Hub
   - Deployment Environment: Kubernetes Cluster
   - Number of Replica Sets: 3
   - Number of Pods: 3

3. Resilience Testing Goals
   The primary goals of resilience testing for Entitments-Hub are as follows:
   - Identify and evaluate how the application handles different types of failures.
   - Measure the application's ability to recover gracefully from failures.
   - Ensure that critical functionalities remain available even under adverse conditions.

4. Testing Scenarios
   Resilience testing will cover the following scenarios:
   a. Pod Failures
   b. Node Failures
   c. Network Failures
   d. Resource Exhaustion

5. Test Cases
   Each testing scenario will have specific test cases to evaluate the application's behavior during failures. These test cases should cover:
   - Application response time during failures.
   - Data consistency and integrity.
   - Graceful degradation of non-critical features.
   - Monitoring and alerting during incidents.

6. Testing Tools and Infrastructure
   - Use Kubernetes tools for orchestrating failures.
   - Implement monitoring and logging with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Ensure a test environment that mirrors the production setup.

7. Testing Schedule
   - Define a testing schedule and maintenance window for carrying out the tests.
   - Ensure that testing activities do not impact production users.

8. Failure Recovery
   - Document the expected recovery time for each type of failure.
   - Identify any manual intervention required for recovery.

9. Metrics and Reporting
   - Capture and analyze key performance metrics during testing.
   - Document the test results, including successes and failures.
   - Provide recommendations for improvements based on test outcomes.

10. Risk Mitigation
    - Outline a plan for mitigating identified risks and vulnerabilities.
    - Ensure that corrective actions are implemented promptly.

11. Conclusion
    This resilience testing document serves as a guide for evaluating the Entitments-Hub UI application's ability to maintain functionality in the face of failures. Regular testing and monitoring are essential to ensure the application's reliability and robustness in a production environment.
